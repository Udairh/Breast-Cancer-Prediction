# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Mini Project using Python Libraries and ML Models


Breast Cancer Prediction Using Neural Network :
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict whether breast cancer is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) using the famous Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset from scikit-learn. The dataset contains various medical measurements for breast cancer cell features, and the goal is to classify cancer cases based on these features.
